// while Statement

// The while statement executes the statements until the condition is not false. The
// syntax for 'while' loop is 

// Syntax
while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
  }


  Ex:
  while (i < 10) {
    text += "The number is " + i;
    i++;
  }
//   output:
//   The number is 0
//   The number is 1
//   The number is 2
//   The number is 3
//   The number is 4
//   The number is 5
//   The number is 6
//   The number is 7
//   The number is 8
//   The number is 9




// First, the condition is evaluated and if it is true, then the statements are executed and
// again the condition is tested. The execution stops when condition returns false.
