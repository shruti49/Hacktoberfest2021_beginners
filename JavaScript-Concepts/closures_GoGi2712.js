/*
* What is Closure?

* A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.

* A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables — scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function’s variables, and it has access to the global variables.

* Let see a closure example below:
*/
function User(name){
  var displayName = function(greeting){
   console.log(greeting+' '+name);
  }
return displayName;
}
var myFunc = User('Raj');
myFunc('Welcome '); //Output: Welcome Raj
myFunc('Hello '); //output: Hello Raj

/*
* In this code, We have an outer function User() which returns an inner function as displayName(),
* The inner function will have access to the variables in the outer function scope, even after the outer function has returned.
